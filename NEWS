* Version 1.2.0, November 14, 2014

New in this version:
 - Summary report - summaries of certain scanners' results which may be
   emailed to users.
 - Automatic retrieval of sitemap.xml, i.e. no explicit upload required.
 - You can now specify a number of individual recipients of scan reports.
   The organization contact will no longer receive these emails by default.
 - Details of specific scan are always copied to the scan report; a technical
   occurrence log has been added to the report to help diagnose scan failures
   and conversion errors, etc.
 - Minimize false positives: Many more irrelevant CPR matches are ignored.
 - Group concept to enforce access limitations within one organization is
   mostly implemented; due to some issues, its use is discouraged until next
   sprint.
 - CSV file with report was broken in some cases.
 - Overview page listing domains per organisation is now available for
   superusers.
 - Pooling of PostgreSQL connections is now possible (but STRONGLY
   DISCOURAGED!)
 - Scanner listing is now sorted by date.
 - The Name rule has been completely removed from the GUI.
 - Small images are ignored, i.e. not OCR'ed.
 - Organization is included in all lists where relevant (superuser only).
 - Scheduled scans didn't run if set for specific dates.
 - Admin-related menu items have been consolidated in an admin menu.
 - Installation instructions have been updated and now work.
 - Installation instructions include how to set up crontab for scheduled
   scanning.
 - Links in scan reports now open in a new window.
 - Minimize false positives: CPR matches are ignored in inline style tags.

   support very long lists.
 - Improved GUI design.
 - Spreadsheets in formats XLSX/XLS/ODS are now scanned correctly.
 - Improvements and bug-fixes to the XML-RPC interface.

* Version 1.1.0.5, November 4, 2014

   removed.
 - Better error handling in processing of conversion items if an
   image's dimensions cannot be determined.


* Version 1.1.0.4, October 29, 2014

 - Performance improvement: When the number of OCR items per scan reaches a
   certain limit, non-OCR conversions are paused to allow the number of OCR
   items to fall to a reasonable level before being resumed again. For large
   scans with OCR enabled, this is necessary because so many OCR items are
   extracted from PDFs or Office documents that it exhausts the number of
   available inodes on the filesystem.
 - Connnection pooling is removed due to database problems.


* Version 1.1.0.3, October 10, 2014

New in this version:

 - Bug fix: Catch InternalError exception in process_manager.py.

   the active scans to avoid one scan hogging the queue.


* Version 1.1.0.2, October 10, 2014

New in this version:

 - Bug fix: CPR check using wrong digit to validate birth date. The CPR rule
   was using the 8th digit instead of the 7th digit of the CPR number to
   validate the birth date of CPR numbers.
 - Periodically delete conversion queue items from finished scans that may
   not have been properly cleaned up when they finished.
 - Ignore and delete images extracted from converted files if their are
   dimensions do not meet minimum dimensions: both width and height must be
   >= 7 pixels and at least one dimension must be >= 64 pixels.
 - Scans are logged to separate files in var/logs/scans rather than
   polluting the web server's error log file.
 - Pool PostgreSQL connections to avoid too heavy load on the database server.
 - System status page for superusers.


* Version 1.1.0, September 23, 2014

New in this version:

 - Better parsing of names to avoid false positives.
